<ProtocolDescription>

  <Intro>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
  This is a simple text protocol in a "human readable form". Text protocol was chosen because
  it's easier to debug and implement on the client side. It does require some more overhead,
  but since server and clients do not communicate much anyway, this is not an issue.
  </p>

  <h3>Nomenclature</h3>
  <p>
  We use two terms for "clients": <i>client</i> and <i>user</i>.
  At first, <i>user</i> was considered to be a registered or logged-in client.
  The two terms are used uncleanly though, so you may best think of them as equal.
  </p>

  <h4>Formating rules: lines, words and sentences</h4>
  <p>
  All communication must be encoded in utf-8. Binary data is not permitted.
  </p>
  <p>
  A <i>line</i>, also known as a <i>message</i>, consists of a single protocol command, plus its arguments, communicated as a single string, and terminated by a newline character (\n).
  Lines may be of any length; 600 KB long strings have been verified to worked in both directions. 
  A natural implementation of the protocol will result in almost all lines being under 1 KB in length.
  <!--Nevertheless, some commands (like <clink name="AGREEMENT"/>) do divide the data they send into several lines, but only for clarity.-->
  </p>
  <p>
  Each line begins with a <i>command</i>, written in capitals. 
  The arguments of the command, which come next, come in two types: <i>words</i> and <i>sentences</i>. 
  Word arguments are sequences of non-whitespace characters, and are separated from each other by whitespaces.
  Sentence arguments are sequences of words (separated by whitespaces), 
  which are considered as a single argument.
  Sentences arguments are seperated from each other by tab characters (\t).
  </p>
  <p>
  The word arguments of a command <i>always</i> come first, followed by its sentence arguments.
  The last word argument is separated from the first sentence argument by a single whitespace.
  Some examples:
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> <clink name="JOINEDBATTLE"/>, with 2 word arguments: <br/><code>JOINEDBATTLE 25869 oxido</code></li> 
  <li> <clink name="UPDATEBATTLEINFO"/>, with 4 words and 1 sentence argument: <br/><code>UPDATEBATTLEINFO 25903 1 0 -210360064 Trojan Hills v03</code></li>
  <li> <clink name="BATTLEOPENED"/>, with 10 words and 4 sentences: <br/><code>BATTLEOPENED 4437 0 0 BlackHoleHost6 71.2.10.1 8626 10 0 0 -1213614804 Spring 104.0 &#160;&#160; Coastline_Dry_V1 &#160;&#160; The BlackHoleHost - Conflict &#160;&#160; Balanced Annihilation V9.46</code></li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  (So, when a client talks to the server, if you want to include a tab character in a sentence, you can't!)
  </p>

  <h4>Legend</h4>
  <p>
  The following notation is used within the arguments of a command.
  A given argument should be assumed to be a word, unless {} is present, in which case it is a sentence.
  <ul>
    <li>{...} = a sentence arg </li>
    <li>{...} {...} = two sentence args (which should be separated by a tab character!)</li>
    <li>| = multiple choices for the argument i.e. "OR"</li>
    <li>[...] = an optional argument</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h4>Argument order</h4>
  <p>
  All commands, except for some developer/admin specific commands, are listed below.
  Their arguments are listed in order, and should be sent in that order.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a small number of cases, the arguments of a command were different in earlier versions of the protocol. 
  The details below refer to the latest version of the protocol, and assume that the client has all the latest compatibility flag present.
  </p>
  <p>
  <!-- For future use (currently only applies to PROMOTE):
  A few commands require that they be invoked using a JSON format, which allows arguments to be named (and, consequently, sent in any order).
  Named arguments can be written in any order and the names are case sensitive, e.g. username != userName.
  The main benefit of named arguments is that they help with backwards compatibility when the protocol changes, and it is planned that more commands will use JSON in future, particularly commands related to statuses and battles. 
  -->
  </p>

  <h3>Protocol rules</h3>
  <h4> Keep-alive signals</h4>
  <p>
  A client must maintain a 'constant' connection with the server, to ensure that network timeouts and disconnects can be detected.
  If no data is being transfered, the client must send <clink name="PING"/> commands to the server at regular intervals -- every 30 seconds is recommended.
  The server will reply with a <clink name="PONG"/> command.
  If no data or ping command has been sent for 60 seconds, the server will assume a network timeout and disconnect the client.
  Similarly, if the client does not hear back within 30 seconds of a ping, it should assume the server has gone down.
  </p>
  <h4>Zero status assumption</h4>
  <p>
  When a client joins the server, the client will be notified about statuses of users only for cases where this status is non-zero.
  A client's status and battle status should be assumed to be 0, if not specified otherwise by the server.
  (This saves on bandwidth, not that we really need to...)
  </p>
  
  <h4> Status change updates </h4>
  <p>
  Most of the commands that notify about some changes are forwarded to the source of the change.
  For example: When a client sends a <clink name="MYBATTLESTATUS"/> command,
  the server sends a <clink name="CLIENTBATTLESTATUS"/> command to all users in the battle,
  including the client who sent the <clink name="MYBATTLESTATUS"/> command.
  This allows the client to synchronize their local status with the server's, 
  after the server has verified that the status change is valid; therefore, it also serves as confirmation mechanism.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Message IDs</h4>
  <p>
  Any message can be prefixed with a message ID.
  For example:
  <code>
  '#123 SAY main hello world!'
  </code>
  is a valid <clink name="SAY"/> command with message ID 123. The server will use this ID in any message sent as a reply, for example:
  <code>
  '#123 SAID main Betalord hello world!'
  </code>
  would communicate the greeting on to other clients with a <clink name="SAID"/> command.
  </p>
  <p>
  The message ID has only one function: to ease tracking server responses for the client.
  They makes it easier to implement commands that require multiple responses in both directions.
  You can also use them with <clink name="PING"/>/<clink name="PONG"/> to measure your round trip time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Message IDs should be non-negative values, within 31-bit range (so, 0 up to 2147483647).
  Negative values are reserved by the server for internal use.
  </p>

  <p>
  <h3>Sub-systems</h3>
  </p>

  <h4>Email Verification</h4>
  <p>
  If a valid 'server_email_account.txt' exists (in the same directory as <code>server.py</code>), then Uberserver will carry out email verification. 
  In order to verify an email address: the server sends a four digit verification code to an email address, the user/lobby must send this code back to the server.
  Each verification code is valid for 24h, and allows max 3 attempts at verification.
  Currently, the same email address can be used to verify multiple accounts, but this may change in future.
  </p>
  <p>
  If email verification is enabled, then it is required for registering a new account and for changing email address.
  In this case, both <clink name="REGISTRATIONACCEPTED:server"/> and <clink name="CHANGEEMAILREQUEST:server"/> cause a verification code to be created, and sent.
  The verification code is expected back in <clink name="CONFIRMAGREEMENT"/> and <clink name="CHANGEEMAIL"/> respectively.
  It can be re-sent, up to three times, using <clink name="RESENDVERIFICATION:client"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lobby clients should always assume that verification is enabled.
  However, if verification is not enabled, then all email address and verification code fields can be left blank (or fed arbitrary data). 
  In this case, no verification codes will be sent, and all verification attempts will automatically pass.
  </p>

  <h4>Match-Making</h4>
  <p>
  By match-making, we mean a somewhat abstract way of automating
  the process of users finding each other in battle rooms
  and then starting a game of a type that they like.
  </p>
  <p>
  Currently, we don't have match-making. 
  We do have a <clink name="FORCEJOINBATTLE:client"/> command,
  and a compatibility flag 'm', 
  which might one day form the basis for a match-making system.
  Contact a server admin if you are interested in developing this!
  </p>

  <h4>Syncing</h4>
  <p>
  To be in <i>sync</i> means to have the same versions of all the content
  required to play a particular game (including the map, engine, dependencies, etc).
  See <clink name="JOINBATTLE:server"/> or the unitsync documentation for details.
  </p>

  <h4>Hole punching</h4>
  <p>
  <quote>
  Hole punching is a networking technique
  for establishing communications between two parties in separate organizations
  who are both behind restrictive firewalls.
  </quote>
  <url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching</url>
  We use it to allow clients to connect to the lobby server, that would otherwise not be able to. 
  See the commands
  <clink name="TASSERVER"/>,
  <clink name="OPENBATTLE"/>,
  <clink name="UDPSOURCEPORT"/>,
  <clink name="CLIENTIPPORT"/>,
  <clink name="HOSTPORT"/>.
  <!--It will probably not work in LAN mode, especially if combined with players from the internet.-->
  </p>
   
  <h4>Decoupling games from battle-rooms</h4>
  <p>
  At some point we hope to implement the  
  <clink name="CONNECTUSER:client"/> command set. There are the only commands documented below that are currently unimplemented.
  These commands will allow to initiate games without creating/joining a battle-room.
  </p>

  <h3>Hosting battles</h3>
  <p>
  Any client may host a <i>battleroom</i>, also referred to as a <i>battle</i>, which is (effectively) a special type of chat channel with extra features related to setting up and launching a multi-player game.
  A client may join at most one battleroom at any given time. 
  This includes when the client is hosting the battle. The server automatically enforces this rule.
  </p>
  <p>
  Clients detect whether a battle has a game currently in progress by monitoring the hosts status.
  For example, if the hosts status changes to "in game", then the battles is "in game".
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>spring.exe</code> uses UDP connections for online multi-player games (TCP is not suitable due to latency).
  These connections are made between the host client (of the battleroom) and non-host clients. 
  Consequently, the lobby protocol contains a set of commands dedicated to setting up UDP connections between host/non-host clients.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Setting up UDP connections: non-host perspective </h4>
  
  <p>
  Before joining a battle, a client is expected to first acquire their UDP source port from the server.
  This is done by sending a UDP packet, which a response coming via <clink name="UDPSOURCEPORT"/>.
  Once the client has done that, the client should keep sending UDP packets to the server at regular 20 second intervals, 
  to keep the connection alive and ensure that the clients router does not remove the UDP connection from its port translation table.
  After <code>spring.exe</code> is launched, these UDP keep-alive signals may be discontinued (because then <code>spring.exe</code> will be sending regular UDP packets).
  Once <code>spring.exe</code> exits, the client should resume sending UDP keep-alive signals.
  </p>
  <p>
  Just before starting the game, the host should send a <clink name="HOSTPORT"/> command to the user,
  containing the host's public UDP source port.
  The lobby cient should replace the battles port with this one,
  as it will have to connect to the game using this port and not the original one
  (that was acquired through the <clink name="BATTLEOPENED"/> command).
  </p>
  <p>
  Note: If the client is not hosting, then it does not need to "punch through", which is does have to do when hosting, because <code>spring.exe</code> will take care of that. <i> Todo: make this clearer!</i>
  </p>
  
  <h4> Setting up UDP connections: host perspective </h4>
  <p>
  Before sending the <clink name="OPENBATTLE"/> command,
  the host should try to acquire its UDP source port from the server,
  just to make sure it can acquire it at all
  (better to find out it does not work before hosting,
  than right before starting the game).
  However, the client does not need to keep this UDP connection alive,
  since it will not be used to actually host the game.
  It is just a test to see if UDP connectivity works.
  </p>
  <p>
  When a new client joins the battle,
  the server will send a <clink name="CLIENTIPPORT"/> command to the host,
  informing the host of this client's public UDP source port.
  The host should remember this information,
  as he will have to use it when starting the game.
  </p>
  <p>
  Right before starting the game,
  the host should try to acquire his source port again.
  This time he will actually use this port to host the game.
  Upon starting the game,
  the server will notify all clients participating in his battle about his port,
  using the <clink name="HOSTPORT"/> command.
  The host does not need to keep refreshing his connection
  to keep the port open,
  as spring.exe will do that for him.
  Upon returning from the first game that was hosted in his battleroom,
  the host does not need to keep refreshing it either (as a client would have to do --
  because when the host starts a new game
  it will have to acquire a new source port anyway).
  </p>
  
  <h4> Why? </h4>
  <p>
  This setup exists because some host clients might play "single-player" games with bots
  before opening their battleroom to other players,
  in which case any UDP port that was originally set up would have long ago timed out (spring.exe would not keep it alive during a single player game!).
  For this reason, the host has to acquire a new UDP port each time it starts a battle.
  </p>

      <Description>
      Sent to a client who just joined the channel.
      Note: Multiple commands of this kind can be sent in a row.
      The server takes the list of clients in a channel,
      separates it into several lines and sends each line seperately.
      This ensures no line is too long,
      because the client may have some limit set on the maximum line-length
      and it could ignore the line if it was too long.
      Also note, that the clients user-name is sent in this list too!
      So when the client receives a JOIN command,
      he should not add his name in the client list of the channel,
      but he should wait for the CLIENTS command,
      which will contain his name too
      and he will add himself automatically then.

      </Arguments>
      <Description>
      Sent by a client (battle host), to inform other clients about current
      battle configuration (start positions type, mod options, map options...).
      Only the battle host itself needs to write the corresponding script tags
      into script.txt, other battle clients should merely use them for display
      purposes.

      The [pair] format is "key=value can have spaces". Keys may not contain
      spaces, and are expected to use the '/' character to separate tables, see
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>SETSCRIPTTAGS game/startmetal=1000</li>
        <li>SETSCRIPTTAGS game/startenergy=1000</li>

        <li>SETSCRIPTTAGS game/diminishingmms=0</li>
        <li>SETSCRIPTTAGS game/ghostedbuildings=1</li>
      </ul>
      Though in reality, all tags are joined together in a single command.
      Note that when specifying multiple key+value pairs,
      they must be separated by TAB characters.

      All keys are made lowercase by the server.

      See the examples bellow.
